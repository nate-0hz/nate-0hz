## Next steps...

My learning journey is far from over. 

I am constantly looking for opportunities to improve skills and efficiencies in my current stack, and am highly open to learning new languages, frameworks and technologies.

My current skills are stronger in backend development, and databases, and I am actively working on strengthening front end development skills.

React Native or  Electron, .NET, and C++ are frameworks and languages I am particularly interested in learning in the near future.
